Finished creating a grid that can toggle rendering a Debug mode.

Established basic functions and techniques for populating Field with Squares for future game Blocks.

Both Grid and Blocks can change scale depnding on Size variable. In the future, add a function to change Size dynamically to scale with the dimensions of the screen rendering the app.
