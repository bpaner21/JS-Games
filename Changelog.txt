Finished creating a grid that can toggle rendering a Debug mode.

Established basic functions and techniques for populating Field with Squares for future game Blocks.

Both Grid and Blocks can change scale depending on Size variable. In the future, add a function to change Size dynamically to scale with the dimensions of the screen rendering the app.

App now scales dynamically with the dimensions of the window using an event listener. The problem is, however, that re-drawing the canvas while changing causes a weird stilted look as though the program is skipping.

The program now has a render loop so that it changes every time a new animation frame is requested.

A color scheme has been added to the app so that the eventual Tetris pieces will be properly differentiated from one another.

Goals for the next update:

* Create a way to spawn pieces

* Add controls to move pieces left/ right and to rotate them

* Create a system so that pieces move down automatically, persist after they finish dropping

Can now spawn a line piece with the ability to move left/ right and rotate

Added a check the program so that a piece stays within the bounds of the grid even after rotating.

The rotation check however uses a while-loop that always does one too many iterations. Not a big issue to work around, but it does irritate my sense of programming aesthetics.

Goals for next update:

* Automatically move pieces down

* Have pieces stay in place once they collide with a piece and are able to populate unoccupied spaces on the grid

* Spawn a new piece once the previous have been set in the grid

The rotation check no longer does an extra iteration.

The piece now moves down automatically

A function to set a piece in place in unoccupied spaces of the grid was added

A new function was added to clear full rows

A 3-dimensional array was created to contain the starting positions of the pieces' individual squares

The app was cleaned up to exclude dead code and irrelavent comments

* The draw squares functions were kept because they are still useful for debugging

For-loops have replaced forEach() statements because they are less costly

The CreatePiece() function was changed in preparation of spawning new pieces

-

Known bugs:

When a piece rotates, there is a chance of it clipping into a filled space on the grid

-

Goals for next update:

Implement piece array in the CreatePiece() function to test new pieces

Change the piece array and rotation function so that the axis of rotation is [0] instead of [2]

Figure out where in the piece rotation function the clipping issue is happening
