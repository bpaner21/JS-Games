Finished creating a grid that can toggle rendering a Debug mode.

Established basic functions and techniques for populating Field with Squares for future game Blocks.

Both Grid and Blocks can change scale depending on Size variable. In the future, add a function to change Size dynamically to scale with the dimensions of the screen rendering the app.

App now scales dynamically with the dimensions of the window using an event listener. The problem is that However, re-drawing the canvas while changing causes a weird stilted look as though the program is skipping.

The program now has a render loop so that it changes every time a new animation frame is requested.

A color scheme has been added to the app so that the eventual Tetris pieces will be properly differentiated from one another.

Goals for the next update:

* Create a way to spawn pieces

* Add controls to move pieces left/ right and to rotate them

* Create a system so that pieces move down automatically, persist after they finish dropping
